##  v0.5.0 [2018-06-02] Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

Bugfixes:

## v0.4.0 [2017-12-11] Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

Enhancements:

- Add caching and #inserted/#removed callbacks for aspect-membership to Systems.
- Add Aspect#archetype and Archetype.from_aspect
- Add Aspect#matches? to match individual entities
- Add fixtures collection
- Normalize entity IDs in the World API
- Add constructor arguments to component-creation paths

  /removed events
- Pull up common #inspect functionality into a mixin and use it everywhere.

Changes:

- The `every_tick` callback is now only passed the delta and the tick count

  the old methods)

##  v0.3.0 [2017-05-31] Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

Changes:

- Rename Assemblage to Archetype to follow Artemis's naming.
- Rename Entity#get_component to #find_component to more accurately
  reflect what it does. Aliased to the old name for backward
  compatibility, but the alias will likely be removed before 1.0.

Enhancements:

- Add a Chione::Component() coercion method
- Allow a component to be added to an entity by name or class
- Add an #entities method to System for easy iteration by subclasses.

- Make Assemblage, Component, Manager and System all pluggable.

- Extract a method for creating blank Entities to facilitate
  overriding which Entity class is used.
- Defer event processing until the event loop so events which are
  published at startup aren't missed.
- Allow shorthand required component list for system aspects


##  v0.1.0 [2017-05-22] Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

Enhancements:

- Refactor the World start/stop logic to make it easier to override in
  implementations which have their own process models.
